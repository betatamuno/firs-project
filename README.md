In my first week at the Developer Academy Bootcamp, I worked on two projects using the basic Python skills we’ve been learning. The first was a dice rolling program that randomly picks a number between 1 and 6 and displays it. The second was a number guessing game where the program generates a random number and the user keeps guessing until they get it right, with hints if the guess is too high or too low. These projects helped me practice using the random module, variables, loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
In my second week at the develper academy i worked on the mountadventure game which and the labortory game, The first part of the game is called Treasure Hunt. It’s an adventure-style game where the player has to pick a direction and then guess which compartment holds the treasure all while avoiding a monster. To start, we made a list with two directions: left and right. Then we used random. shuffle () so the correct direction changes every time the game runs, keeping it unpredictable. We created a function that asks the player which way they want to go. If they pick the right direction, they get to move on to the treasure compartments. If they choose wrong, the game ends right there. Once inside the treasure room, the player gets three chances to guess the correct compartment number. We used a while loop to track their attempts and converted their input to an integer so we could check if it’s a winning number. If the player picks a number 5 or higher, a monster catches them and its game over. But if they pick a number between 1 and 4, they win for example, when I picked 3, I won. We also added an elif statement so if the player picks the wrong direction at the start, the game stops immediately. And finally, we handled cases where someone might type something other than left or right by using an else condition, which just prompts them to try again by calling the treasure hunt () function.
The second part of the game is the lab game. The player chooses whether to go to the experiment area or the storage room. If they go to the experiment area, they’re asked if hydrogen is a gas. Answering "yes" wins the game, "no" loses, and anything else prompts them to type properly.  If they go to the storage room, they’re asked if they want to wear protective equipment. Saying "yes" means they win, "no" means the monster gets them, and other answers trigger a reminder. If they type anything besides "E" or "S" when choosing a section, it asks them again.
