In my first week at the Developer Academy Bootcamp, I worked on two projects using the basic Python skills weâ€™ve been learning. The first was a dice rolling program that randomly picks a number between 1 and 6 and displays it. The second was a number guessing game where the program generates a random number and the user keeps guessing until they get it right, with hints if the guess is too high or too low. These projects helped me practice using the random module, variables, loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
